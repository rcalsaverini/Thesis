\qitem{
I've heard there was a secret chord\\
That David played, and it pleased the Lord\\
But you don't really care for music, do yah?\\
It goes like this:\\
The fourth, the fifth,\\
The minor fall, the major lift,\\
The baffled king composing Hallelujah.\\[1.5ex]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, \ldots\\[1.5ex]
Your faith was strong but you needed proof.\\
You saw her bathing on the roof.\\
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew yah.\\
She tied you to a kitchen chair,\\
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair,\\
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah.\\[1.5ex]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah\\[1.5ex]
There was a time when you let me know\\
What's really going on below,\\
But now you never show it to me, do yah?\\
And remember when I moved in you\\
The holy dove was moving too\\
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah\\[1.5ex]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah\\[1.5ex]
Maybe there’s a God above\\
But all I’ve ever learned from love\\
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew yah.\\
It’s not a cry you can hear at night,\\
It’s not somebody who has seen the light,\\
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah.\\[1.5ex]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah\\[1.5ex]
You say I took the name in vain.\\
I don't even know the name.\\
But if I did, well, really, what's it to yah?\\
There's a blaze of light in every word,\\
It doesn't matter which you heard:\\
The holy or the broken Hallelujah\\[1.5ex]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah\\[1.5ex]
I did my best, it wasn't much.\\
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch.\\
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool yah.\\
And even though it all went wrong\\
I'll stand before the Lord of Song,\\
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah\\[1.5ex]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah\ldots}
{----\textsc{Hallelujah, música de Leonard Cohen}}
